# 🔧 **Common Methods Used for Time Series Tests**

## 1️⃣ **Stationarity Tests**

> To check whether the statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) of a series are constant over time.

* **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test**

  * Most widely used to test stationarity.
  * Null hypothesis: Series has a unit root (non-stationary).
* **Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) Test**

  * Tests for stationarity around a deterministic trend.
  * Null hypothesis: Series is stationary.
* **Phillips-Perron (PP) Test**

  * An alternative to ADF; corrects for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity.

---

## 2️⃣ **Autocorrelation Tests**

> To check for serial correlation (dependency between observations).

* **Ljung-Box Q Test**

  * Tests whether any of a group of autocorrelations is different from zero.
* **Durbin-Watson Test**

  * Checks for first-order autocorrelation.
* **Breusch-Godfrey Serial Correlation LM Test**

  * More general autocorrelation test (higher-order autocorrelation).

---

## 3️⃣ **Heteroscedasticity Tests (for volatility modeling)**

> Whether variance changes over time.

* **ARCH Test (Engle's Test)**

  * Checks for presence of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH effects).

---

## 4️⃣ **Structural Break Tests**

> Whether parameters of the time series model change over time.

* **Chow Test**

  * Tests for a single known break point.
* **CUSUM and CUSUMSQ Tests**

  * Tests for cumulative sum of residuals for stability.
* **Zivot-Andrews Test**

  * Tests for unit root with structural break.

---

## 5️⃣ **Normality Tests (for residual diagnostics)**

> Whether residuals follow normal distribution (important for some models).

* **Jarque-Bera Test**
* **Shapiro-Wilk Test**
* **Anderson-Darling Test**

---

## 6️⃣ **Granger Causality Tests**

> Whether one time series can predict another.

* **Granger Causality Test**

  * Tests for lead-lag relationships between two time series.

---

## 7️⃣ **Cointegration Tests**

> Whether two or more non-stationary time series move together over time.

* **Engle-Granger Cointegration Test**
* **Johansen Cointegration Test**

---

## 8️⃣ **Forecast Accuracy Tests (Model Evaluation)**

> Comparing performance of models.

* **Diebold-Mariano Test**

  * Tests whether two forecasting models have the same accuracy.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), RMSE**

  * Simple but important measures for forecast evaluation.
