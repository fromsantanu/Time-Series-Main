# üî∞ **STAGE 6 ‚Äî Auto ARIMA & SARIMA Modeling**

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **The Problem with Manual ARIMA**

* Choosing p, d, q manually can be tedious.
* Sometimes we may miss the best combination.
* Seasonal effects are not handled well with simple ARIMA.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Solution: `auto_arima()`**

* It automatically searches for the best combination of p, d, q.
* It can also detect seasonality.
* Available in `pmdarima` package.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Installation**

```bash
pip install pmdarima
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Using Auto ARIMA**

```python
import pmdarima as pm

# Auto ARIMA on log-transformed data
model_auto = pm.auto_arima(df['Sales_log'],
                           start_p=0, start_q=0,
                           max_p=5, max_q=5,
                           seasonal=False,   # First do non-seasonal
                           trace=True,
                           error_action='ignore',
                           suppress_warnings=True,
                           stepwise=True)

print(model_auto.summary())
```

‚úÖ You will see which (p,d,q) combination it selects.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecast with Auto ARIMA Model**

```python
n_periods = 30
forecast_log, conf_int_log = model_auto.predict(n_periods=n_periods, return_conf_int=True)

# Reverse transformation back to original scale
forecast_orig = np.exp(forecast_log)
conf_int_orig = np.exp(conf_int_log)

# Create forecast date index
forecast_dates = pd.date_range(df.index[-1] + pd.Timedelta(days=1), periods=n_periods)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(df['Sales'], label='Original')
plt.plot(forecast_dates, forecast_orig, label='Forecast', color='red')
plt.fill_between(forecast_dates, 
                 conf_int_orig[:,0], 
                 conf_int_orig[:,1], 
                 color='pink', alpha=0.3)
plt.title('Auto ARIMA Forecast')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

‚úÖ **What we achieved:**

* Fully automatic model selection
* Forecast generation with confidence intervals

---

# üî∞ **Handling Seasonality: SARIMA**

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **If you have seasonal data:**

* Daily sales may have weekly/monthly seasonality.
* Use **Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)**.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Auto SARIMA Example:**

```python
model_auto_seasonal = pm.auto_arima(df['Sales_log'],
                                    start_p=0, start_q=0,
                                    max_p=3, max_q=3,
                                    seasonal=True,
                                    m=7,   # weekly seasonality
                                    trace=True,
                                    error_action='ignore',
                                    suppress_warnings=True,
                                    stepwise=True)

print(model_auto_seasonal.summary())
```

‚úÖ `m=7` means 7-day seasonality (weekly), you can set `m=12` for monthly if your data was monthly.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecast as before** ‚Äî same as previous code.

---

üëâ **Your task:**

* Try both non-seasonal and seasonal auto\_arima.
* Experiment with different seasonal periods.
* Watch how model AIC improves.

---

---

# üî∞ **NEXT STAGE**

Now you know:

* ‚úÖ Manual ARIMA
* ‚úÖ Auto ARIMA
* ‚úÖ SARIMA for seasonal data

‚úÖ **Stage 7 will be: Model Evaluation ‚Äî How to validate models properly (Train-Test split, cross-validation, error metrics like RMSE, MAPE etc.)**
