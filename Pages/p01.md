# 🕰️ What is a Time Series?

A **time series** is a sequence of data points measured at successive points in time, usually at equal intervals.

### 📈 Examples:

* Daily temperature readings
* Monthly sales revenue
* Stock prices every minute
* Heartbeat data per second
* Yearly GDP of a country

# 🎯 Objective of Time Series Analysis

The **goal** is to:

1. **Understand the underlying structure** and patterns of the data.
2. **Model the data** to explain past behavior.
3. **Forecast future values** based on past observations.

# 🧩 Key Components of Time Series

| Component                | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trend**                | Long-term increase or decrease in the data                       |
| **Seasonality**          | Repeating patterns at regular intervals (daily, weekly, yearly)  |
| **Cyclic Patterns**      | Irregular rises/falls not of fixed period (like economic cycles) |
| **Irregularity (Noise)** | Random variation or unexpected shocks                            |

| Category                 | Techniques                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visualization**        | Line plot, moving average, seasonal decomposition  |
| **Stationarity Testing** | ADF test, KPSS test                                |
| **Modeling**             | AR, MA, ARMA, ARIMA, SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing |
| **Machine Learning**     | Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM, Prophet              |
| **Forecasting**          | ARIMA Forecast, Holt-Winters, Facebook Prophet     |

# 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

| Domain        | Application                                  |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Finance       | Stock price forecasting, volatility modeling |
| Retail        | Sales prediction, inventory planning         |
| Weather       | Forecasting temperature or rainfall          |
| Healthcare    | ECG monitoring, disease spread modeling      |
| Manufacturing | Fault detection in machinery                 |
| Economics     | Inflation, unemployment trends               |

# 🔁 Time Series Analysis vs Cross-Sectional Analysis

| Feature    | Time Series                           | Cross-Sectional                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Focus      | One entity over time                  | Multiple entities at a single point |
| Example    | GDP of India over 20 years            | GDP of 20 countries in one year     |
| Dependency | Autocorrelation (past affects future) | Independent observations            |

# 📊 Why Time Series is Unique?

Time series data has **temporal dependence** — observations depend on past values. This is unlike typical statistical data where observations are assumed independent.

# ✅ Summary

> **Time Series Analysis is about understanding and predicting how things change over time** — by recognizing patterns, trends, and cycles in sequential data.
