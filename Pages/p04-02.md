# 🔰 **STAGE 2 — Time Series Components**

---

### 1️⃣ Concept:

Time series usually have:

* **Trend** — long-term direction
* **Seasonality** — repeating patterns
* **Residual/Noise** — random fluctuations

We can decompose them.

---

### 2️⃣ Code for Decomposition:

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose

# Perform decomposition
result = seasonal_decompose(df['Sales'], model='additive', period=30)

# Plot the decomposition
result.plot()
plt.show()
```

✅ Note: We are assuming monthly seasonality (roughly 30 days).

---

✅ **What we learned:**

* Break time series into parts
* Visual inspection of trend and seasonality

---

👉 **Your task:**

* Try different `period=` values (e.g., 7 for weekly)
* Observe how seasonality changes
