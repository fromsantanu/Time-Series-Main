# Stationarity

## 🌟 **1. What is Stationarity? (Layman Explanation)**

✅ **Imagine weather in your city.**

* If **average temperature stays the same** over years (say always \~30°C in May), then it is **stationary**.
* If **average temperature keeps increasing** every year (e.g. due to global warming), it is **not stationary**.

🔑 **Stationarity in Time Series** means:

* The **overall pattern remains the same over time**.
* No **upward or downward trend**.
* No change in **variance (spread of data)**.

---

### 🧠 **Why is Stationarity Important?**

Most **time series forecasting models** like ARIMA assume data is stationary because it is easier to predict something that has a stable behaviour.

If data is **not stationary**, we need to **transform** it (e.g. take difference, log transform) to make it stationary before modeling.

---

## 🔬 **2. Technical Definition**

A **time series is stationary** if:

1. **Mean (average)** is constant over time.
2. **Variance (spread)** is constant over time.
3. **Covariance (relation between current and past values)** depends only on the lag, not on actual time.

---

## 🧪 **3. How do we Test for Stationarity?**

### **Common Tests:**

1. **ADF (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) Test**

   * Null Hypothesis (H0): Time series is **non-stationary**.
   * If **p-value < 0.05**, we reject H0 → Data is **stationary**.

2. **KPSS (Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin) Test**

   * Null Hypothesis (H0): Time series is **stationary**.
   * If **p-value < 0.05**, we reject H0 → Data is **not stationary**.

🔑 **Tip:** ADF and KPSS are used together for stronger conclusion.

## 🐍 **4. How to Perform ADF Test using Python**

Here is a **step-by-step practical example** using Python:

```python
# Step 1: Install and import required library
# You can install via: pip install statsmodels

import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

# Step 2: Create or load your time series data
# Example: Let's create dummy data with trend (non-stationary)

data = {'Month': pd.date_range(start='2020-01', periods=12, freq='M'),
        'Sales': [100, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 145, 150, 155, 160, 170]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.set_index('Month', inplace=True)

# Step 3: Perform ADF test
result = adfuller(df['Sales'])

# Step 4: Print the results
print('ADF Statistic:', result[0])
print('p-value:', result[1])
print('Critical Values:', result[4])

# Step 5: Interpret
if result[1] < 0.05:
    print("Conclusion: Data is Stationary.")
else:
    print("Conclusion: Data is NOT Stationary.")
```

### 💡 **Key Outputs Explained**

* **ADF Statistic:** The test statistic value.
* **p-value:** Probability of data being non-stationary. If <0.05 → Stationary.
* **Critical Values:** Thresholds for different confidence levels.

## 📝 **5. Final Summary for Layman**

✔️ **Stationarity** = Data with **consistent behaviour over time**.
✔️ **Why needed?** Because most models assume data pattern is stable.
✔️ **How to check?** Use **ADF Test** in Python.
✔️ **If not stationary?** Transform data (e.g. differencing) to make it stationary before forecasting.

# Differencing

## 🌟 **1. Why Do We Need Differencing?**

When **ADF Test shows data is not stationary**, we **difference** it to remove:

✅ **Trend (upward/downward movement)**
✅ **Seasonality (regular periodic changes)**

🔑 **Differencing means:** Subtracting current value by previous value to eliminate trend or seasonality.

---

### 📊 **Example – Understanding Differencing (Layman)**

Imagine sales data increasing every month:

| Month | Sales |
| ----- | ----- |
| Jan   | 100   |
| Feb   | 110   |
| Mar   | 120   |

* **Original data** shows an upward trend.
* **First difference** will be:

| Month | Diff (Sales) |
| ----- | ------------ |
| Feb   | 10           |
| Mar   | 10           |

Now the series is flat (**no trend**), meaning **stationary**.

---

## 🐍 **2. Implementation in Python (Step-by-Step)**

### 🔷 **Step 1. Import libraries and create data**

```python
import pandas as pd
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample non-stationary data with trend
data = {'Month': pd.date_range(start='2020-01', periods=12, freq='M'),
        'Sales': [100, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 145, 150, 155, 160, 170]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
df.set_index('Month', inplace=True)

# Plot original data
df['Sales'].plot(title='Original Time Series')
plt.show()
```

---

### 🔷 **Step 2. Perform ADF Test on original data**

```python
result = adfuller(df['Sales'])
print("ADF p-value (Original):", result[1])

if result[1] < 0.05:
    print("Data is stationary.")
else:
    print("Data is NOT stationary.")
```

---

### 🔷 **Step 3. Apply First Order Differencing**

```python
# First differencing
df['Sales_diff1'] = df['Sales'] - df['Sales'].shift(1)

# Drop the first NaN value
df_diff = df.dropna()

# Plot differenced data
df_diff['Sales_diff1'].plot(title='First Differenced Time Series')
plt.show()
```

---

### 🔷 **Step 4. Perform ADF Test on differenced data**

```python
result_diff = adfuller(df_diff['Sales_diff1'])
print("ADF p-value (First Difference):", result_diff[1])

if result_diff[1] < 0.05:
    print("Differenced data is stationary.")
else:
    print("Differenced data is STILL not stationary. Consider seasonal differencing or other transformations.")
```

---

### 🔷 **Step 5. Further Steps if Still Non-Stationary**

If **first differencing doesn’t work**, try:

1. **Second differencing:**

```python
df_diff['Sales_diff2'] = df_diff['Sales_diff1'] - df_diff['Sales_diff1'].shift(1)
```

2. **Seasonal differencing:** For seasonal data (e.g. monthly with yearly seasonality):

```python
df['Sales_seasonal_diff'] = df['Sales'] - df['Sales'].shift(12)
```

3. **Log transform** to stabilize variance:

```python
import numpy as np
df['Sales_log'] = np.log(df['Sales'])
```

---

## 🔬 **3. Final Summary**

✔️ **Stationarity is essential** for time series forecasting.
✔️ **Differencing removes trend/seasonality** to make data stationary.
✔️ **First differencing** is usually sufficient.
✔️ **Always check with ADF test after differencing** to confirm stationarity.
