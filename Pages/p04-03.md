# 🔰 **STAGE 3 — Stationarity Check**

---

## 1️⃣ **Concept: What is Stationarity?**

* A time series is **stationary** if:

  * Mean is constant over time
  * Variance is constant over time
  * Autocovariance does not depend on time

**Why important?**
👉 Most time series models (like ARIMA) require stationary data.
👉 If data is non-stationary, we need to transform it.

---

## 2️⃣ **How to Check Stationarity?**

We will use:

* **Visual check** (plotting rolling statistics)
* **Statistical test** — *Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF)*

---

## 3️⃣ **Rolling Statistics Plot**

We calculate rolling mean and standard deviation.

```python
# Rolling statistics
rolling_mean = df['Sales'].rolling(window=30).mean()
rolling_std = df['Sales'].rolling(window=30).std()

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
plt.plot(df['Sales'], label='Original')
plt.plot(rolling_mean, color='red', label='Rolling Mean (30 days)')
plt.plot(rolling_std, color='black', label='Rolling Std (30 days)')
plt.legend()
plt.title('Rolling Mean & Standard Deviation')
plt.show()
```

👉 **If rolling mean and std stay flat, the series is stationary.**

---

## 4️⃣ **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test**

Let’s do a formal test.

```python
from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller

adf_result = adfuller(df['Sales'])

print('ADF Statistic:', adf_result[0])
print('p-value:', adf_result[1])
for key, value in adf_result[4].items():
    print('Critical Value (%s): %.3f' % (key, value))
```

---

✅ **How to Interpret:**

* **Null hypothesis (H0):** The series is non-stationary.
* **Alternative hypothesis (H1):** The series is stationary.
* If **p-value < 0.05**, we reject H0 → *stationary*.
* If **p-value >= 0.05**, we fail to reject H0 → *non-stationary*.

---

✅ **What we learned:**

* Stationarity concept
* Visual rolling stats
* ADF test

---

👉 **Your task:**

* Run both codes.
* Note down whether your data is stationary.
* Play with different window sizes.

---

# 🔰 **NEXT STAGE**

If your data is *non-stationary*, we have to transform it.

✅ **Stage 4 will be: Making data stationary (Differencing, Transformation, etc.)**
