# Structural Break

## 🌟 **1. What is Structural Break? (Layman Explanation)**

✅ **Imagine you run a shop.**

* For many months, your daily sales are stable.
* Suddenly, a new supermarket opens nearby → your sales drop permanently.

🔑 This **sudden permanent change** in your data pattern is called a **structural break**.

---

### 🧠 **In Time Series:**

A **structural break** is when the **statistical properties (mean, variance, trend) of data change at a certain point in time**.

---

### ✅ **Examples:**

1. **Economic policy change** → GDP growth rate changes.
2. **Company changes CEO** → profits trend differently.
3. **COVID-19 outbreak** → air travel drops drastically.

---

### 💡 **Why is Structural Break Important?**

✔️ Forecasting models assume data pattern is stable.
✔️ **If there is a structural break, model without accounting for it will be inaccurate.**

---

## 🔬 **2. Technical Definition**

A **structural break** implies:

* A change in **regression relationship** at a certain point.
* It violates the assumption of **parameter stability** in time series models.

---

### **Common Tests for Structural Breaks:**

1. **Chow Test (simple break at known point)**
2. **CUSUM Test (cumulative sum control chart)**
3. **Bai-Perron Test (multiple unknown breakpoints)**

---

## 🐍 **3. How to Perform Structural Break Tests in Python**

Here is a **step-by-step practical example using Chow Test** with explanation:

---

### 🔷 **Step 1. Install and import libraries**

```python
# Install via: pip install linearmodels

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from linearmodels.iv.model import IV2SLS
from linearmodels.iv.results import chow_test
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

---

### 🔷 **Step 2. Create sample data with structural break**

```python
# Create time series with a break at observation 50
np.random.seed(42)
x = np.arange(100)
y = np.piecewise(x, [x < 50, x >= 50], [lambda x: 2 + 0.5*x + np.random.normal(0,1,len(x)),
                                        lambda x: 10 + 0.8*x + np.random.normal(0,1,len(x))])

# Create DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})

# Plot
plt.scatter(df['x'], df['y'])
plt.title("Time Series with Structural Break")
plt.show()
```

---

### 🔷 **Step 3. Perform Chow Test**

#### 📝 **Note:** Chow Test tests **if there is a break at a known point** (e.g. observation 50 here).

```python
# Prepare data for Chow Test
break_point = 50
x1 = df.loc[:break_point-1, 'x']
y1 = df.loc[:break_point-1, 'y']
x2 = df.loc[break_point:, 'x']
y2 = df.loc[break_point:, 'y']

# Combine for regression
X = df['x']
Y = df['y']
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# Full model
model_full = sm.OLS(Y, X).fit()

# Sub models
X1 = sm.add_constant(x1)
model1 = sm.OLS(y1, X1).fit()

X2 = sm.add_constant(x2)
model2 = sm.OLS(y2, X2).fit()

# Chow test calculation
from statsmodels.stats.diagnostic import compare_lr_test

RSS_pooled = sum(model_full.resid ** 2)
RSS1 = sum(model1.resid ** 2)
RSS2 = sum(model2.resid ** 2)

k = X.shape[1]  # number of parameters
n1 = X1.shape[0]
n2 = X2.shape[0]

F = ((RSS_pooled - (RSS1 + RSS2)) / k) / ((RSS1 + RSS2) / (n1 + n2 - 2 * k))

from scipy.stats import f

p_value = 1 - f.cdf(F, k, n1 + n2 - 2 * k)

print("Chow Test F-statistic:", F)
print("p-value:", p_value)

# Interpretation
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Conclusion: Structural break is present at the breakpoint.")
else:
    print("Conclusion: No structural break detected at the breakpoint.")
```

---

### 🔷 **Step 4. Using Bai-Perron Test for unknown multiple breaks**

For **multiple unknown breaks**, use **`ruptures` package** (practical, widely used):

```python
# Install via: pip install ruptures

import ruptures as rpt

# Detect change points
model = "l2"  # least squared deviations
algo = rpt.Binseg(model=model).fit(df['y'].values)
result = algo.predict(n_bkps=2)  # n_bkps = number of breakpoints

# Plot
rpt.display(df['y'].values, result)
plt.title("Bai-Perron (Ruptures) Multiple Breakpoints Detection")
plt.show()

print("Breakpoints detected at indices:", result)
```

---

## 💡 **4. Final Summary (Layman)**

✔️ **Structural Break = sudden permanent change in data pattern**.
✔️ **Why important?** Ignoring breaks leads to wrong models.
✔️ **How to check?**

* Use **Chow Test** if break point is known.
* Use **Bai-Perron (Ruptures)** if break point is unknown.
